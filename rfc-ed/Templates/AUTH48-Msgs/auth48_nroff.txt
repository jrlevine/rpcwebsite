This is the template file for email messages sent to notify authors
that their document is in AUTH48 state and available for review
(when using an NROFF source file).
The template text becomes the body of the message. (Headers are
handled differently.)

Text above the marker "TEXT:" is igored. The message is below that
marker. Other markers are substituted based on the table below.

Instructions for Completing AUTH48

This is your last chance to make changes to your RFC-to-be: 
RFCDRAFT.txt.
Once the document is published as an RFC, we will not make changes.
Please follow the instructions below to complete the AUTH48 process.
(For frequently asked questions, please see 
https://www.rfc-editor.org/faq/#auth48.)

1) Review the edited document completely.  The files are available here:

   https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/LCXXXX.txt
   https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/LCXXXX-diff.html

   We recommend reviewing the entire document, not just the diff file.
   FYI, https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff provides tools to make various
   kinds of diff files.

2) Review and resolve (as necessary) any questions raised by the RFC Editor.
   The questions (if any) will be sent in a subsequent AUTH48 email.

3) Send us your changes or respond with your approval for publication.  
   Please use 'REPLY ALL' so that rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org and the parties
   CC'ed on this message receive your response. Note that your document will
   not move forward until we have received approvals from each of the
   authors listed on the front page.

   Note that, because you are listed in the document header, you are 
   responsible for reviewing and approving the RFC-to-be for publication.
   As part of that, you are also responsible for engaging other parties 
   (e.g., Contributors or Working Group) as necessary before providing 
   your approval.

   If sending changes, please provide us with an explicit list of changes
   via email. Please send the changes in this format:

      Section # (or indicate Global)
   
      OLD:
      old text
   
      NEW:
      new text

   Be sure to pay particular attention to these areas of the document:
   - IANA Considerations updates (if applicable)
   - Contact information
   - Copyright notice and legends (see item 6 for more details)

4) Send a list of suitable keywords for this document (beyond those 
   that appear in the title) for use on https://www.rfc-editor.org/search

5) Review changes submitted by your coauthors (if any).  We assume that 
   you will speak up if you do not agree with the proposed changes. 
   That is, your silence is your assent to changes submitted by your 
   coauthors. Note that any changes that are beyond editorial will be 
   sent to the relevant body for approval.

6) Review the copyright notice and legends as defined in RFC 5378 and the
   Trust Legal Provisions (TLP -- https://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/).

   If your document was approved for publication with a pre-RFC-5378
   copyright notice, we have applied the text from section 6.c.iii of the
   TLP.  Please consider whether this text is required (note that the
   6.c.iii text is not applicable to Alternate Stream RFCs).  See item
   4.5 of the "Copyright FAQ" at https://trustee.ietf.org/faq.html for
   guidance on whether this text applies to your document.

7) Please reply, as the document will not be published until we receive
   approvals from each author.  The details of the AUTH48 status of your
   document are here:

   https://www.rfc-editor.org/auth48/LCXXXX

Thank you for your cooperation,

RFC Editor
