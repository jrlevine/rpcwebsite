TEXT:
Author(s),

Your document DRAFT_NAME, which has been approved for publication as 
an RFC, has been added to the RFC Editor queue 
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/current_queue.php>. 

If your XML file was submitted using the I-D submission tool 
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/>, we have already retrieved it 
and have started working on it. 

If you did not submit the file via the I-D submission tool, or 
if you have an updated version (e.g., updated contact information), 
please send us the file at this time by attaching it 
in your reply to this message and specifying any differences 
between the approved I-D and the file that you are providing.

If you have any style guidance for the terms used in your document 
(capitalization, hyphenation, use of quotation marks and underscores, 
etc.), please send us mail with your draft string in the subject line. 
This should help increase the pace with which documents move through 
the RFC Editor queue. 

The first step that we take as your document moves through the queue 
is converting it to RFCXML (if it is not already in RFCXML) and 
applying the formatting steps listed at 
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/pubprocess/how-we-update/>. 
Next, we will edit for clarity and apply the style guide 
(<https://www.rfc-editor.org/styleguide/>). 

You can check the status of your document at 
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/current_queue.php>. 

You will receive automatic notifications as your document changes 
queue state (for more information about these states, please see 
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/queue/>). When we have completed 
our edits, we will move your document to AUTH48 state and ask you
to perform a final review of the document. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you.

The RFC Editor Team
